Unable to find a set of cup holders for my 67 Cobra that fit in the limited space available and were also affordable, I decided to make my own.

After several iterations in Fusion 360, I came up with this three piece design. I split the cup holders in half and made the cubby separate as well to accommodate the size of my print bed.

I printed these with PolyMaker PloyLite PLA Pro and then epoxied them  together. The basic design fits the space between the seats without obstructing anything and its large enough to not tip over.

I had considered trying to upholster the cup holders to match the dash, but ultimately decided to flock them with Suede-Tex black flocking fibers. I was barely able to upholster the dash and have it look good, I seriously doubt I could upholder a shape as as complex as this and have it look decent.

I forgot to take pictures of the flocking process, but it's simple (if a bit messy). You place the part in a garbage bag lined box, cover the part in glue, then puff on the fibers with a special cardboard tube. The fibers are super fine so a respirator is a good idea.

I think the resulting finish not only looks good, but matches the carpet close enough it doesn't call attention to itself.

The aluminum inserts were a bit oversized, so I printed a set of sleeves out of PolyMaker PolyFlex TPU 90. The sleeves just slide in and snug up a bit on my water bottle and dampen rattling sounds.
